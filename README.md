I  have two classes: 
  -Program.cs
  -TennisGame.cs

I have two input files:
  -Females.csv
  -Males.csv
  
And 1 ouput file:
  -ouput.txt


The program takes each first row from females.csv and first row from males.csv to make a record that is used for the computation of the good match percentage. and so and so on. 

i computes the:
  -good match percertage for each record created. 
  -Sort the output in descending order
  -compute the good match on the data sets in reverse
  -compute the average good match score for each combination. 
  
 to run the application start on Program.cs class.
